# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Concepts
- A programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing and structuring code.

## 4 basics
### Encapsulation
- **Concept**
   - Object hides its internal state and implementation from outside.
- **Benefits**
   - Prevents the risk of unintended interference with the object's state.
  
### Abstraction
- **Concept**
   - Define interface without specifying the implementation details.
- **Benefits**
   - Provides a clear and abstract view of objects.

### Inheritance
- **Concept**
   - Create a child class based on an existing parent class. The child classe inherits data and methods from the parent class.
- **Benefits**
   - Promotes code reuse by allowing you to extend and specialize existing classes without duplicating code.

### Polymorphism
- **Concept**
   - One function of an object (interface) can behave differently due to binding the interface on different classes.
- **Benefits**
   - Enables you to write code that works with objects of different types through a common interface.
